# rustici_software_cloud_v2

RusticiSoftwareCloudV2 - the Ruby gem for the SCORM Cloud Rest API

REST API used for SCORM Cloud integrations.

This SDK is automatically generated by the [Swagger Codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project:

- API version: 2.0
- Package version: 2.1.0
- Build package: io.swagger.codegen.languages.RubyClientCodegen

## Installation
### Gem
[rustici_software_cloud_v2](https://rubygems.org/gems/rustici_software_cloud_v2)

### Local:
Build the Ruby code into a gem:

```shell
gem build rustici_software_cloud_v2.gemspec
```

```shell
gem install ./rustici_software_cloud_v2-2.1.0.gem
```
For development, run `gem install --dev ./rustici_software_cloud_v2-2.1.0.gem` to install the development dependencies

Finally add this to the Gemfile:

    gem 'rustici_software_cloud_v2', '~> 2.1.0'

## Tips and Tricks
Working with headers will require calling the `WithHttpInfo` version of the function. This allows for grabbing the header directly from the response object:
```ruby
# Note: This code is specifically designed to not modify any existing data
dispatch_api = RusticiSoftwareCloudV2::DispatchApi.new
response = dispatch_api.update_dispatches_with_http_info(RusticiSoftwareCloudV2::UpdateDispatchSchema.new, {since: Time.now.strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%L') + 'Z'})
puts response[2]["X-Total-Count"]
```

## Changelog:
Check the [changelog](https://cloud.scorm.com/docs/v2/reference/changelog/) for details of what has changed.

## Sample Code
```ruby
require 'rustici_software_cloud_v2'
require 'open-uri'
include RusticiSoftwareCloudV2


# ScormCloud API credentials
# Note: These are not the same credentials used to log in to ScormCloud
APP_ID = 'APP_ID'
SECRET_KEY = 'SECRET_KEY'

# Sample values for data
COURSE_PATH = '/PATH/TO/COURSE/RunTimeAdvancedCalls_SCORM20043rdEdition.zip'

# This sample will consist of:
# 1. Creating a course.
# 2. Registering a learner for the course.
# 3. Building a link for the learner to take the course.
# 4. Getting the learner's progress after having taken the course.
# 5. Viewing all courses and registrations.
# 6. Deleting all of the data created via this sample.
#
# All input variables used in this sample are defined up above.

    # Sets the default OAuth token passed with all calls to the API.
    #
    # If a token is created with limited scope (i.e. read:registration),
    # calls that require a different permission set will error. Either a
    # new token needs to be generated with the correct scope, or the
    # default access token can be reset to nil. This would cause the
    # request to be made with basic auth credentials (appId/ secret key)
    # instead.
    #
    # Additionally, you could create a new configuration object and set
    # the token on that object instead of the default access token. This

    # course_api = CourseApi.new(ApiClient.new(config))

    # of authorization.
